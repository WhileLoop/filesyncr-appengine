## Intro

A GWT based Google App Engine application file sharing application with chat functionality. Uses App Engine Blob Store to store file blobs, App Engine Datastore to persist metadata, and Channels API to implement push notifications of file updated and chat room functionality. Files can be dragged and dropped to rearrange the order of the files in the table. All actions are pushed to all connected clients in real time.
